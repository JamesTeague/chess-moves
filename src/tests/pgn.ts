In our introductory file I wouldlike to give you an overview of our repertoire. This is not a comprehensivefile of every single line, rather it can serve you as a roadmap as to White\'sand Black\'s options. I will also outline where I present several options forBlack and my thoughts on how you can pick your preferred lines. }1. e4 c6 { Here we go! Our idea is to occupy the center with c6-d5 and adopt a lightsquare strategy. By attacking White\'s e4 pawn we also strive to give our Bc8 ahome on f5 square, although as we will see we don\'t always utilize thepossibility. } 2. d4 { Surely the best move for White is to occupy the centerbut he also has some other viable options } (2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 { Is a verypopular and sound variation known as the "Two Knights." This variation hasseen a surge of popularity in the last years as it has been recommended inseveral White repertoires and new ideas have been found. } 3... Bg4 { is the solidand most popular move. The main line goes } (3... dxe4 { Capturing on e4 seeksto transpose to positions seen in the Tartakower Classical variation (see mainline) which have been revived with new ideas for Black in recent years. } 4. Nxe4 Nf6)  (3... a6 { This little pawn nudge is roughly 50x less popular thanthe main move 3..Bg4 so it contains great surprise value. It also scores 56%for Black! We are making a small useful waiting move to control the b5 squareand considering playing Bg4 at a more opportune moment. }) 4. h3 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 e6 { Where White is happy to get the bishoppair but Black is very solid and puts the pawns on the light squares. Therehave been many setups tried for White here but I have an offbeat suggestionfor Black involving a Kingside fianchetto: } { [%csl Gb7,Gc1,Gc6,Gd5,Ge6,Gf1,Gf7] })  (2. Nf3 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 { is an offshoot type of Exchange Variation of the Caro. White goes for simpledevelopment but lets Black do the same. The resulting middgames are give uscomfortable play as I will show in the files. })  (2. c4 { is known as the"Pseudo-Panov" and after } 2... d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. cxd5 (4. d4 { is the Panov }) 4... Nf6 { White has some options to try to cause trouble before Black collects thepawn back and short castles. With knowledge of a few key lines Black willemerge in good shape. I would say this line is not really seen much nowadaysand is not popular at club level, although it is completely respectable. })  (2. d3 { is a "KIA" (Kings Indian Attack) setup which of course will have it\'sKings Indian fans. I\'ve definitely seen it a fair bit online and several timesOTB but we will get a good game by taking over the center } 2... d5 3. Nd2 (3. exd5) 3... e5)  (2. f4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bb5+ Nc6 5. Nf3 a6 6. Ba4 (6. Bxc6+ bxc6 7. d4 g6 8. O-O Bg4 9. h3 Bxf3 10. Qxf3 e6) 6... b5 7. Bb3) 2... d5 3. Nc3 { Protecting the pawn with Nc3/Nd2 is known as the "Classical"variation. Nothing more classical than developing a piece and protecting thecenter! This variation remains extremely popular but in my opinion is not aschallenging as the Advance variation (3. e5). } (3. Nd2 dxe4 { Will transpose to3. Nc3 })  (3. e5! { I believe that the Advance Variation may be the "best"line at White\'s disposal. The idea is clear: grab the space! Now the main moveis 3...Bf5, a move that is certainly very adequate and developing. However, Iam rolling with the less popular 3..c5! } 3... c5!? 4. dxc5! { This greedy move isconsidered critical. White grabs the pawn and dares Black to retrieve it! } (4. c3 { This is a very important move to analyze. Although 4. dxc5! is arguablemost challenging, 4. c3 is roughly 3x more popular at the club level. Howeverthis move is not so tough as it allows Black a version of a "good french".Something like: } 4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Be2 e6 { is an example! The position has a French structure (e4 e6d4 d5 e5 c5) with the key distinction of Black\'s Bc8 being active on g4! Thisis another reason I am happy to recommend 3..c5: many opponents willunwittingly allow us this juicy continuation. } { [%csl Rd4,Gg4][%cal Gd8b6,Gg8h6,Ge7f5,Gh6f5] })  (4. c4!? { is an aggressiveoption }) 4... Nc6!? { This is the ambitious way to continue. We refuse toclose the Bc8! I think that unless White has deep theoretical knowledge of theposition then Nc6 would be my choice (and has been vs several master+ players).However White does have some challenging retorts that we need to deal with. } (4... e6 { is a solid alternative }))  (3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bd3 { This is the "Exchange Variation" and is a very popular line withMasters and Amateurs alike. It is also a very frequent guest in online play.The allure of this line for White is the promise of a simple developmentalsetup with potential attacking chances. } { [%cal Gc1f4,Gc2c3,Gg1f3] } (4. c4 { This is the "Panov-BotvinnikAttack." This variation often gives rise to the famous "IQP" (Isolated Queen\'sPawn) structures that has been debating and analyzed endlessly over the pastcentury. There isn\'t anything particularly wrong with this line for White inmy view its popularity has been dwindling. I used to place it in the "BigFour" of Classical, Advance, and Exchange variations but I think now the TwoKnights is more popular. Anyway, my main recommendation is the g6 fianchettowhich can be very unpleasant for White to face if he is unprepared (a commonissue here for club/amateur players!). My surprise recommendation is one thatI\'ve used successfully myself and will either give you a second option or youcan even make it your main idea! } 4... Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 { My preference. Byfianchettoing our Bf8 we keep the Bc8 open and also seek to put additionalpressure onto the d4 pawn. } (5... Nc6 6. Nf3 (6. Bg5 Ne4!? { This line canlead to very dynamic play }) 6... Be6 { Surprise! This quirky move seeks toresolve the pressure on the d5 pawn and force White to make a decision. }) 6. Nf3 (6. Qb3! Bg7 7. cxd5 { is the main and critical line. We sacrifice a pawnbut will try to collect it back in the future! Again as I have said aboutseveral of the lines in this overview, this is a line that either a Master orwell prepared opponent will use. Of course I have analyzed this idea deeply togive you good retorts in either case. Nevertheless if you are facing anunprepared or amateur opponent then the inferior 6. Nf3?! will be seen moreoften! }) 6... Bg7 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nc6 { is a pleasant anti-IQP position! } { [%csl Rd4][%cal Gg7d4,Gd8d4,Gc8g4,Gb7b6,Gc8b7] }) 4... Nc6 5. c3 Nf6 (5... Qc7 { This main line option prevents Bf4 and hasgenerally scored very strongly for Black. } { [%cal Rc1f4] }) 6. Bf4 Bg4 { continues simpledevelopment and usuall White wil try to attack our kingside while we storm thequeenside } (6... g6!? { This was the first line I learned vs the Exchange Ireally liked and have shown it to many of my students. The resulting positionsare easy to play and White is often unsure how to meet them. Definitelyrecommend this line for u2200 play: } 7. Nd2 Bg7 8. Ngf3 O-O 9. O-O Bf5 10. Bxf5 gxf5 { Black scores 56% here. We will occupy e4 and perhaps use the g-file toattack }))  (3. f3 { This is the "Fantasy Variation". This can be a veryunpleasant line to face without preparation as White seeks to have a bigcenter and attack/squash us. } 3... e6 { Keeping things nice and solid, frustratingWhite. } (3... e5!? { A violent counterattacking gambit! } 4. dxe5 Bc5 { [%csl Re1] }) 4. Nc3 Qb6!? { Bringing the queen out early but placing annoyingpressure on the d4/b2 pawns. This move has scored excellently for Black but isnot very popular. That is a perfect repertoire weapon for my checklist! }) 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 { This variation has been around for a while but perhaps didnot enjoy the best reputation as Black is seemingly doubling his pawns for nogain. However it is apparent nowadays that such thinking was too simplisticand Nf6 is enjoying a big surge in popularity. I definitely think this is themove to learn as your main weapon. } (4... Bf5 { This is the main move and isknown as the Capablanca variation. This move is perfectly fine and I haveplayed it myself for many years and many games } 5. Ng3 Bg6 { White actually hasa lot of pesky sideline setups here but we will just overview the main line } 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 e6!? { is very interesting and a modern twist. Black doesn\'t mindallowing Ne5 and also hopes that the Nb8 may jump to c6 instead in the future.I think Black is doing fine after Nd7 as well but White may be less preparedto deal with this modern try } (7... Nd7 { This is the very well explored "oldmain line" and often times the opening moves are blitzed here } 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bd2 Ngf6 12. O-O-O Be7 13. Kb1 O-O 14. Ne4 Nxe4 15. Qxe4 Nf6 16. Qe2 Qd5 { While both sides had deviations along the way, this is reallythe main line with 750 games played. Again I should say that this "Old MainLine" is fine for black but has arguably been better trodden than the paths of7..e6!? or the earlier 4... Nf6 Tartakower. })) 5. Nxf6+ { Really this makes themost sense but of course we will look at alternatives in the main file. } 5... exf6! { As mentioned, Black does get doubled pawnsbut now development will flow as free as water. Often times Black will alsoget attacking chances on the Kingside by pointing his pieces there andpotentially even sacrificing and pawn storming! } { [%cal Gf8d6,Gc8e6,Ge8g8,Gb8d7] } 6. Nf3 { An unpreparedopponent is way more likely to develop naturally as such and the resultingpositions will give Black excellent play and activity. Although I don\'t thinkNf3 is the best move it is still important to learn and understand theresulting positions for Black. } (6. c3 { This move, or rather the setup thatfollows, has been established as White\'s most testing idea. Many experiencedplayers may know this from reviewing their openings but it is very rare for anunprepared player to play this idea at the board. } 6... Bd6 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Qc2 Re8+ 9. Ne2 { Now Black has to make a decision regarding protecting the h7 pawn.This variation was considered better for White for many years but recently hasbeen a fertile battle ground for many Grandmasters as Black discovered the idea } 9... h5! { This move was first played in 2014 but did not recieve attentionuntil it was repeated in 2017 by several Grandmasters. Since then hundreds ofgames have tested this move and it is firmly the main line. The idea in anutshell is to get the pawn out of harm\'s way and often times push it to h4.The subtleties will be further explored in the Tartakower file. Now White hasa choice: castle long or short? With a few key ideas, Black\'s game will beeasy to handle regardless and I believe this is an excellent repertoire optionfor spirited play }) 6... Bd6 7. h3 O-O 8. Be2 Re8 9. O-O Be6 10. Be3 Nd7 11.

It is a reasonablypopular option for White on all levels, especially scholastic. White is aimingfor an attacking IQP structure where he will rely on the activity of hispieces as well as many well tested maneuvers to attack our king. To cut acrossWhite\'s plans, I\'m recommending the less popular approach of a KingsideFianchetto. The fianchetto setup I am going to show is considered the BEST wayto set up against an IQP structure (more on that below) but it works best whenWhite doesn\'t know the most testing anti-fianchetto idea }1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 { This is the PBA. White is putting pressure against the centerand wishes to reach the famous IQP structure. } 4... Nf6 5. Nc3 g6!? { If we can getaway with setting up a fianchetto system, then we are going to be doing verywell. First of all, our kingside will be very secure against White\'s attackingattempts (usually done with a battery Bc2-Qd3) . Second, our Bg7 will not onlybe a powerful defender but also will exert great pressure against the d4weakness. Finally, since we have not played e6 our Bc8 will be free to wander(although we can put it on b7 as well). Futhermore, I am also a fan of thissystem since it is not well known by our opponents and their usual plans don\'twork against it (you will see I have great emphasis on the practicalapplicability of our openings!). } 6. Nf3?! { This perfectly natural developingmove is already inaccurate. This move looks very natural and it is verypopular. That is great news for us! The reason it is not precise is because itdoesn\'t disturb our position at all. If we get our desired setup in, thenWhite will feel the pain of the weakness of d4. } (6.

In the past there was a prevalent worry that thedoubled pawns would be a long term weakness that would sink Black\'s chances inthe endgame.

An early Be7 is solid and flexible and may transpose to other lines, but don\'t forget the possibility of playing Nd2-Nc4!. An early c5 can lead to the dubious Qb6 when Na3! exploits the wandering queen. Another trick is that an early c5+b6 is met with Nc3! which threatens d5 and Nb5.

First off after our Nc3!? idea Black must already decided if he wants to play d6 or d5. I think d5 is much stronger as d6 allows us a very easy attacking plan on the kingside. True, Black has the c6-Qa5 idea but I think very few players will know it. Even then I found a very rare and extremely dangerous idea for Black that requires immaculate defense to remain in the game. In the main line after d5 our idea is to play e3 w/h4 and even consider a sacrifice with h5! Usually Black will block it with h5 or h6 after which we should try to install a knight on e5. Black\'s best bet is a well timed c5 strike.

After 2..c5 the game can go into the "Vaganian Gambit" which to my eyes looks very impractical for Black. After a quick f4 we are menacing the e5 break and Black must take extreme care not to lose from the opening. After 2..Ne4 I propose the quirky h4!? which looks to activate the Rh1. Black\'s best bet is to play calmly with d5 after which we can reach roughly equal positions with more space on the kingside. Otherwise if Black insists on playing aggressively with c5 and Qb6 we can sacrifice one or even two pawns for a massive intiative.} * [Event "?"] [Site "?"] [Date "????.??.??"] [Round "?"] [White "Chapter 14"] [Black "Trompowsky: Move 2 etc"] [Result "*"] [ECO "A45"] [Annotator "Gotham"] [PlyCount "29"] {The final section of the Trompowsky deals with some unusual move 2 options as well as takes a look at the Trompowsky against 1..d5, aka the "Pseudo-Tromp"} 1. d4 Nf6 (1... d5 2.
